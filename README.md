The files are available as .zip files as "Releases", due to space limitations in repositories

Note that two versions of the corpus are available for download as .zip archives in the “Release” section, both in the “original” format, with a 20 kHz sampling rate, and in the “broadband” format with 44.1 kHz sampling rate.

For more information on this corpus, see the ASA Paper:
